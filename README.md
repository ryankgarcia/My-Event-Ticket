# My Event Ticket

A web application for live event enthusiasts who want to search for entertainment in their area.

## Why I Built This

Since I've been old enough to go to concerts, they have been my **favorite** form of entertainment. While this application is not only limited to concerts, my goal was to create an app that makes calls to an API to retrieve data from an external source. My favorite part about working on this project was the challenge of getting things to look comparable on mobile and desktop and translating that into a favorable user experience. My biggest take away from this project is that working on a mobile first design requires proper planning in order to account for the extra space on larger view ports.
